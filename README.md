# DISLOCK v2.3

DISLOCK is the most advanced Discord Browser Generator.

It is capable of generating Unlocked Tokens for free by Using AI.
DISLOCK is currently undetected by Discord because its Human Emulation.

You will have to use HQ Proxies/IPs to get unlocked tokens.

## Features

- TokenGenerator on discord.com [Almost always Unlocked]
- TokenGenerator on discord.com/register [Mostly Unlocked]
- Captcha Tester on hcaptcha.com

## Proxies

You will have to use HQ Proxies/IPs to get Unlocked Tokens.
If you really want to generate proxies, you maight have to spend fairly big amounts of money, to get undetected/unflagged IPs.
If you just want to test the Generator, you can also just restart your InternetRouter (if you have a rotating IP) and Discord wont notice.

(Btw your Proxy AD can stand here, DM me for offers ;d ;:D)
